# t800-rifle

A rifle modification for the Agora/Hachette T-800 1:2 size Endoskeleton model. This modification brings the standard (silent) gun to life with a number of options:

1. Random fire with realistic sounds and muzzle flash.
2. Optional Laser Pen addition to create phased plasma effect. **NB: Do not fit if using the gun as a toy. Lasers can damage eyes if fired into the face!**
3. Optional trigger to control manual firing.
4. Optional motion detection to automatically fire.

See the following video for an example of automatic random firing with phased plasma bolt effect (smoke/humidifier required for laser visibility).
