# Sound Effect Files

This folder contains the `.m4a` files for various muzzle flashes. Also a script
`m4a2wav.sh` which creates `Tnn.WAV` for each `nn.M4A` file. WAV files take up
more space, but play faster because on the AdaFruit SFX board.

Run the `m4a2wav.sh` script to create the T*.WAV files and then copy them to
the AdaFruit SFX board as specified in the documentation.
